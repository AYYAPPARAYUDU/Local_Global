## ðŸš€ Live Demo

Our full-stack application is live and deployed on the internet. You can test the "live location" features, real-time chat, and the complete checkout process right now.

**Live Website URL:** **[https://local-global.vercel.app/](https://local-global.vercel.app/)**

---





### For Customers:
* **Live Location Filtering:** Automatically finds products from shops nearest to the customer and sorts them by distance (e.g., "5.2 km away").
* **Advanced Real-time Chat:** Start a live chat with any shopkeeper about a specific product.
* **Multi-Step Checkout:** A professional 3-step UI (Shipping $\rightarrow$ Payment Method $\rightarrow$ Pay).
* **Real UPI Payments:** Dynamically generates a scannable QR code based on the shopkeeper's real `upiId` and the exact order total.
* **Secure Payment Flow:** Requires the customer to enter their UTR/Transaction ID to confirm payment before the order is placed.
* **Order Management:** View a complete order history (`/my-orders`).
* **Cancel Order:** Customers can cancel their own orders if the status is still "Processing."
* **Product Reviews:** Leave star ratings and comments on products.
* **Shopping Cart:** A fully persistent shopping cart.

### For Shopkeepers:
* **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** View real-time stats like Total Revenue, Total Orders, and see charts for Weekly Sales and Sales by Category.
* **Product Management (CRUD):** A full dashboard to Add, Edit, and Delete products.
* **Image Uploads:** Upload product images directly to the **Cloudinary** cloud.
* **Advanced Order Management:** A "real-world" workflow to view incoming orders, mark them as "Shipped" (by adding a tracking number), and "Delivered."
* **Shop Settings:** A complete settings page to update shop name, description, return policy, and **UPI ID** for payments.
* **Live Location Setting:** A "Location" tab with an interactive map where shopkeepers can pin their exact store location.
* **Live Chat:** Receive and reply to all customer messages in real-time from the dashboard.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, you will need to run both the `server` and the `Client` in two separate terminals.

### 1. Backend (Server)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the server folder
cd server

# 2. Install all dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env file
# Create a new file named .env in the /server folder and add the following variables:
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
PORT=5000
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# 4. Run the server
npm run dev

2. Frontend (Client)
Bash

# 1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the Client folder
cd Client

# 2. Install all dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create a .env file
# Create a new file named .env in the /Client folder and add the following:
